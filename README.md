Feel free to use this if you want.  I provide no support for this.  I also disclaim any liability.  Use this at your own risk.  I am not responsible for any damages this may cause to you, your radio, or anything else.

Please also note that this is my first Arduino project, and it's very much a learning experience for me.  There may be bad code in here... I'm learning as I go.  If you see anything that needs work, feel free to help me fix it or at least submit an issue.

Enjoy!
